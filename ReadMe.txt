This is an interpreter project for the Concepts of Programming CS 4308, project. The goal of this project is to create a Lexical Analyer, a parser and an evaluator.
The interpreter can detect errors during each of the phases, errors respective to each process. The language will support variable declarations, arithmetic operations 
and either (control flow statements, aggregate data types, or functions).
